# clustering

This contains an exercise by SpringBoard on Clustering adapted from a [blog post by yhat](http://blog.yhat.com/posts/customer-segmentation-using-python.html).

For more details, refer to the jupyter notebook: `Mini_Project_Clustering.ipynb`

This mini project uses a subset of information on marketing newsletters/e-mail campaigns (e-mail offers sent to customers) and transaction level data from customers of a wine merchant. The transactional data shows which offer customers responded to, and what the customer ended up buying. 

The exercise introduces various unsupervised learning concepts:
- K-Means Clustering
  - Choosing K: The Elbow Sum-of-Squares Method
  - Choosing K: The Silhouette Method
  - (Choosing K: The Gap Statistic and Choosing K when we Have Labels)
- Visualizing Clusters using PCA
- Other Clustering Algorithms
  - Affinity propagation
  - Spectral clustering
  - Agglomerative clustering
  - DBSCAN
